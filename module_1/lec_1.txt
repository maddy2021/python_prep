Why Python ?
- Free and Open Source
- Easy to code and Easy to read as well as Easy To Debug : like english language with logic
    example:
        if 59 in range([0,99]):
            print('number is inside the range')
- Object-Oriented Language : Everything in python is object
- High-Level Language : No need to worry about system architecture or memory management
- Portable: will work on all the platform
- Interpreted language
- Big Community and Large number of libraries
- Dynamically Typed Language: No need to specify the Types , python will handle this internally
- Allocating Memory Dynamically :
    example. my_number= 90

Python Case: Snake Case, for class name camlecase

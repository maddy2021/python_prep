List
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

my_list = [1,2,2, "hello", (1,2), 3.15, {x:6, y:8}]  => any datatype is possible in list

- Mutable
- can have duplicates
- Ordered
- Can contains items with different data types

--------------------------------------------------------------------

p_index     0        1        2       3
My_list = [ 1   ,    2    ,   3   ,   4 ]
n_index    -4       -3       -2      -1   

List items can be access by the index like,

x[1] will be 2.
x[1] = 10 #change value to 10

x[0:3] = [1,2,3]
Slice operation will provide shallow copy of list and provide another list

-------------------------------------------------------------------
List Operations:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
clear()	    Removes all the elements from the list
pop()	    Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
count()	    Returns the number of elements with the specified value
index()	    Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	    Sorts the list

Tuples
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Its like list but it is immutable we can not change its value.

- A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses (), separated by commas. 
  The parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice to use them.

my_tuple = (1,2,2, "hello", (1,2), 3.15, {x:6, y:8})  => any datatype is possible in tuple

- immutable
- can have duplicates
- Ordered
- Can contains items with different data types

--------------------------------------------------------------------

p_index      0        1        2       3
My_tuple = ( 1   ,    2    ,   3   ,   4 )
n_index     -4       -3       -2      -1   

Tuple items can be access by the index like,

x[1] will be 2.
x[1] = 10 # Give Error because tuple is immutable datatype

x[0:3] = (1,2,3)
Slice operation will provide shallow copy of list and provide another tuple


Single value tuple:
# We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is a tuple,
var1 = ("Hello") # string
var2 = ("Hello",) # tuple

Advantages of Tuple over List in Python
Since tuples are quite similar to lists, both of them are used in similar situations.

However, there are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list:

1. We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types.
2. Since tuples are immutable, iterating through a tuple is faster than with a list. So there is a slight performance boost.
3. Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists, this is not possible.
4. If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.

Methods:
1. index
2. count

Sets
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*(immutable), and unindexed.

Syntax: 
{'a', 'b' , 'c'}  : anything inside {} 
set(('a','b','c')) : this way also we can define set

using set keyword we can convert list/tuple in set

features:
1. immutable
2. Can not have duplicates
3. Once set is created we can add or remove items in set but can not change it.


Example:

set1 = {1,2,5,6}
set2 = {1,2,'hello','abc', [5,6,7]} 

# set can not have duplicate items in it
set3 = {1,2,2,3} => {1,2,3}


Access Items in set:
my_set = {"python" , "java" , "maths"}
1. chceck java in the set 
-> print("java" in my_set) => True

More examples in sets.py file


Methods:

add()			Adds an element to the set
clear()			Removes all the elements from the set
copy()			Returns a copy of the set

difference()		Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
difference_update()	Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set

intersection()		Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
intersection_update()	Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)

symmetric_difference()	Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
symmetric_difference_update()	inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another

union()			Return a set containing the union of sets
update()		Update the set with the union of this set and others

pop()			Removes an element from the set
remove()		Removes the specified element
discard()		Remove the specified element

isdisjoint()		Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
issubset()		Returns whether another set contains this set or not
issuperset()		Returns whether this set contains another set or not

Dictionary
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is changeable and do not allow duplicates.
python 3.7 and version greater than it will provide ordered dictionary only

Syntax: {}

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

Access Items from dictionary:

1. Give year value from dictionary
-> thisdict["year]

2. Give brand of car
-> thisdict["brand]


Duplicate keys are not allowed and it wont give error but assign the last duplicate key value
example:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 1966
}

Result:
{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1966}


We can assign any datatype in dictionary
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Maruti",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 2020,
  "colors": ["blue", "white", "black"]
}

Methods:
clear()	Removes all the elements from the dictionary
get()	Returns the value of the specified key
items()	Returns a list containing a tuple for each key value pair
keys()	Returns a list containing the dictionary's keys
pop()	Removes the element with the specified key
popitem()	Removes the last inserted key-value pair
update()	Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs
values()	Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
